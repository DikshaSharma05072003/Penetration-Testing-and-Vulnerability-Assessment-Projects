# Penetration-Testing-and-Vulnerability-Assessment-Projects

Conducted SQL Injection attacks, both manually and using Burp Suite, on a legal penetration-testing site to access admin panels, utilizing the Google Hacking Database. Additionally, identified and demonstrated the vulnerability of live camera feeds through Google hacking techniques. These tasks showcase my practical experience in ethical hacking and penetration testing.
